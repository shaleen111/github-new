## Tested On
As of 10th June 2019:
- [x]  Windows 19
- [x]  macOS
- [x]  Linux

## Installation

1. Clone or download an archive of the repo.
2. Install all the requirements of the script by using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage/Examples

1. Run the following command in the terminal:
```
python github-new.py -o TOKEN -s
```

2. (Windows only) Afterwards you may just run the gnew.bat file, however it auto-clones the created repo. Edit the batch file and remove the ```--local``` flag if you don't want to auto clone the repo.


**:warning: This program requires access to oauth/personal access tokens. The tokens are however stored in plaintext form in a 'config.txt'. Keep this security risk in mind before using it. The token to be used by the program should be generated by going to the [Personal Access Tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) on Github.**

## Roadmap

None! This project is as complete as it will ever be!
